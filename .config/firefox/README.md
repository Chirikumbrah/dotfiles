# Firefox settings

The `user.js` contains my personal settings for Firefox. It overrides the settings in `prefs.js`, which is managed by Firefox: contains the defaults, system-specific settings (not portable) and manual changes in `about:config`. The idea is using `user.js` to override generic settings, so that I can use it on different systems.

## Instructions

Copy the `user.js` file to the profile folder in `~/.mozilla/firefox`. To find your user identifier or folder, go to `about:support`.
